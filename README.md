Step 4:- Run command:- "npm install"   
                       "npm run dev" 
                       "npm install react-icons" on a DIFFERENT terminal.
Step 5:- The previous command "npm run dev" will provide a localhost number like 5173 or 5174 or 5175 etc..
         Copy that localhost link and paste it in Google Chrome. Make sure you dont write anything after "npm run dev" on the same terminal as it will result in failure.
